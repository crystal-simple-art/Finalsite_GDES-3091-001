          <br>If you've ever been to a Chinese restaurant outside of China, it's likely you've already experienced eating Cantonese food, or at least some variety of it. Most of the Chinese restaurants abroad are Cantonese restaurants, making Cantonese cuisine the most popular Chinese cuisine around the world and the representative of Chinese cuisines in the world. It consists of three branches: Guangzhou dishes, Chaozhou dishes and Dongjiang dishes, and each has its own characteristics.

      <p>How can design introduce Chinese Culture through Cantonese Cuisine to young audiences?
        <br>
        <br>HOU MEI is a zine that introduces Cantonese Cuisine in different aspects to the Western market through the collaboration of illustration and articles, the use of both English and Chinese. "Hou Mei" means delicious in Cantonese pronunciation. The project focused on cultural exchange through my detailed illustration and easy-to-follow editorial design. The colour palette is limited to two. Instead of using the traditional Chinese red, I decided to use a pastel version of red and yellow in order to excite the current market and young generations. I incorporated the traditional Chinese elements such as extracting the elements of the traditional Horizontal inscribed board and applied to the border of important headlines and subheads.
