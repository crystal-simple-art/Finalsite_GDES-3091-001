          Wildly popular in Hong Kong and quickly gaining a world wide fan base, Dim Sum is as much a social experience as a meal. Literally meaning to touch heart, Dim Sum is about groups of friends dining together and sharing lots of bite sized dishes..You'll usually sit around a revolving table and order a selection of dishes by picking them from a small cart or ticking what you want on a small card. All dishes are then shared.
