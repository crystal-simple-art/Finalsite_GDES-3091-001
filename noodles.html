          <p>Chow fun, broad rice noodles, are a significant type of ingredient of many cantonese dishes. They're also a close relative of ho fun, also known as Shahe fen after the town in Guangzhou where they originated. Wok hei, literally "the breath of the wok," plays a large role in a perfect stir fried chow, the noodles should have a delicate smoky character from the wok's heat and seared oil. A good chow fun should be just oily enough to feel slick and should maintain a slight char without tasting dry or burnt.

            Shahe noodles (shahefen /shaa-her-fnn/) are a kind of rice noodles which probably originated from the town of Shahe that is now a part of Guangzhou. They are broad and white in color. Their texture is elastic and a little chewy. They do not freeze or dry well and are thus generally (where available) purchased fresh in strips or sheets that may be cut to the desired width. Shahefen is popular in Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan in southern China.
