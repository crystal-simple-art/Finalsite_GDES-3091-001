          <p>There's more to Cantonese seafood than steamed and fried fish. Signature dishes include snails stir fried with black bean sauce, fried shell-on salt and pepper shrimp, steamed scallops with ginger and garlic, and other more exotic aquatics like sea
cucumber and jellyfish.
  <br>
  <br>
Since Guangdong bounds the sea, Cantonese people know how to cook seafood really well. White Boiled Shrimp boiled in hot water with the shells may be the first seafood for most domestic and
overseas people to Guangzhou. Make it easy to enjoy the tender meat and the process of peeking as a real Cantonese. What's more, there are a series of restaurants serving Steamed Fish to keep the fresh of the meat with not thick flavored condiments,
so why not try to add more value of your go?
